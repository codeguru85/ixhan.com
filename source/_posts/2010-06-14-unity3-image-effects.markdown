[Unity 3 Feature Preview - Image Effects](http://vimeo.com/12500504) from [Unity3D](http://vimeo.com/unity3d) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Can't wait to see it.

Most important for me, has Unity3 enhanced the Chinese Character Display ?

It's really stupid to using texture to display characters.

And I have to using cocos2d instead because of this.
