It's awfully to say that Time is running out fast , but it really does.

I've been working as a iPhone application developer for five months  ,devoting all my energy to my job . Thanks to company's trust , now I am the core architect and team leader of our small group .

We've redesigned most of default iPhone UI components which is  really a difficult job at first . After a several  days of hardworking  ,We released first custom components named 'MeeTabBarController' , which is more powerful , flexible, and has ability to manage animations for each tabBar ,each container view's opening animations and  closing animations. It really works great and appears amazing.

Since now We've achieved the custom NavigationController, which has more delegate methods , a incredible user interface  and animations. the custom alertView , the custom tableViewController , the custom spring board , the custom http-client for fetching remote data , etc .

It would be no exaggeration to say that our custom framework is just another lite version of Three20 .^^

Here is a Preview version of Our Project:

Here is a snap shoot of our another application which had submitted to apple store and ready for sale .
