> Thanks for Purchasing, [Here is a Plugin for LyricStream. Once it's installed, you no longer need to search and download LRC file manually!](http://ixhan.com/lesslyrics/plugin/)     #[感谢购买,安装本插件即可自动搜索歌词](http://ixhan.com/lesslyrics/plugin/)


LyricStream supports LRC format([WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format))) lyric files.  LRC is lyric text file with timing.

You can find them by searching in google or baidu. You can also create them yourself if you can't find any. Following I will teach you how to search and download LRC file.

For example, to download Lady Gaga's Poker face, just open this [site](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com.hk&sl=auto&tl=en&twu=1&u=http://www.mtvzz.com/&usg=ALkJrhjIH5UhLgQjCR32Vj_BUMBMRbCK1Q)(in chinese, but don't be afraid) , type in "Poker face" and Press "Search it".

So the first one should be right result. Press the little LRC icon on the right to download it. that's it :D

Last thing, you need to make LyricStream works with this LRC file, following these steps:



	
  1. rename LRC file to "ArtistName--SongName.Lrc", so the gaga's LRC file will be "Lady GaGa--Poker Face.Lrc"

	
  2. open LyricStream, find the music icon on your status bar, switch "LRC Manager", it will tell you how many lyric files you already have.

	
  3. press "show lyrics folder" button, drag LRC file to there. and then rescan lyrics. it should appears on Lyrics Window.

	
  4. Play the Poker Face song, you should see the fantastic Lyric Stream Effect!
